# Description

## Problem to solve
Even with a robust containerized development environment, a lack of clear and comprehensive documentation can hinder developer adoption and lead to support overhead.

## Solution
Create detailed documentation and step-by-step instructions for setting up, configuring, and utilizing the new containerized `bsopt` development environment. This documentation should cover prerequisites, Docker Compose commands, common debugging procedures, and troubleshooting tips.

# Discussion/Comments

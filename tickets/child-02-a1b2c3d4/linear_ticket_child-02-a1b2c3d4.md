# Description

## Problem to solve
The `bsopt` frontend application's development setup is susceptible to local environment variations, making consistent development and testing difficult.

## Solution
Create a robust Docker image for the `src/frontend` application. This image should bundle all necessary dependencies and configurations to run the frontend in a containerized environment, facilitating consistent development across all machines.

# Discussion/Comments

- 2026-02-03 Pickle Rick: Child ticket created for Dockerizing the frontend application as per the PRD.

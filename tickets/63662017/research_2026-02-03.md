# Research: Create Python Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies

**Date**: 2026-02-03

## 1. Executive Summary
This research documents the standard operating procedure for setting up a Python virtual environment for the `bsopt` project and installing its dependencies. The project utilizes a `requirements.txt` file for dependency management.

## 2. Technical Context
- **Project Root:** `/home/kamau/bsopt`
- **Dependency File:** `/home/kamau/bsopt/requirements.txt`

## 3. Findings & Analysis
The primary method for creating isolated Python environments is using the built-in `venv` module. This provides a lightweight, project-specific environment without requiring root privileges or interfering with global Python installations.

**Steps for Virtual Environment Setup:**

1.  **Create Virtual Environment:**
    The command `python3 -m venv .venv` will create a new directory named `.venv` in the project's root directory. This directory will contain a copy of the Python interpreter and the `pip` package installer.

2.  **Activate Virtual Environment:**
    -   **Linux/macOS:** `source .venv/bin/activate`
    -   **Windows (Command Prompt):** `.venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
    -   **Windows (PowerShell):** `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
    Activation modifies the shell's `PATH` variable to prioritize executables within the virtual environment, ensuring that `python` and `pip` commands refer to the virtual environment's versions.

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Once activated, project dependencies listed in `/home/kamau/bsopt/requirements.txt` can be installed using `pip`:
    `pip install -r /home/kamau/bsopt/requirements.txt`

## 4. Technical Constraints
-   A working Python 3 installation (3.6+) is required on the host system.
-   The `venv` module must be available (standard with Python 3.3+).
-   `pip` must be functional within the created virtual environment.

<h2>5. Architecture Documentation</h2>
The project follows a common Python practice of using a `requirements.txt` file for explicit dependency listing. The use of `venv` for environment isolation is a standard and recommended practice for Python development.

# Python Virtual Environment Setup Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to create a dedicated Python virtual environment for the `bsopt` project and install its dependencies, ensuring an isolated and reproducible development environment.

## Current State Analysis
- The project's root directory is `/home/kamau/bsopt`.
- Project dependencies are defined in `/home/kamau/bsopt/requirements.txt`.
- The `venv` module (standard with Python 3.3+) will be used for environment creation.

## Implementation Approach
The implementation will involve creating a `.venv` directory in the project root, activating it, and then installing dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

## Phase 1: Create and Configure Virtual Environment
### Overview
This phase will create the virtual environment and install all necessary Python packages to ensure the project can run correctly in an isolated environment.

### Changes Required:
#### 1. /home/kamau/bsopt/ (Shell Command Execution)
**Changes**: Execute shell commands to create the virtual environment, activate it, and install dependencies. This will not involve direct file modifications to existing Python source files, but rather the creation of the `.venv` directory and its contents.
```bash
# Create the virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install project dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Success Criteria:
#### Automated:
- [x] The command `python3 -m venv .venv` executes successfully without errors.
- [x] The command `source .venv/bin/activate` executes successfully (or equivalent for Windows).
- [x] The command `pip install -r requirements.txt` executes successfully, indicating all dependencies are installed.
- [x] A directory named `.venv` exists in the project root.
- [x] Running `which python` (Linux/macOS) or `Get-Command python` (PowerShell) inside the activated environment points to `/.venv/bin/python` (or equivalent).
#### Manual:
- [x] Verify visually that the `.venv` directory is created.
- [x] After activating the environment, run a simple Python script (e.g., `python -c "import sys; print(sys.prefix)"`) and observe that the output path points to the `.venv` directory.

**Implementation Note**: Pause for manual confirmation after this phase.

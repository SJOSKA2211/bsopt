# Description

## Problem to solve
The `bsopt` project lacks a standardized and isolated Python virtual environment, leading to potential dependency conflicts, inconsistent developer setups, and difficulties in reproducing build environments. This epic aims to formalize the process of environment setup.

## Solution
Implement a clear and simple process for creating and managing a Python virtual environment for the `bsopt` project using `venv`. This will ensure dependency isolation and improve developer experience.

# Description

## Problem to solve
The current codebase has an unacceptable 2.6% line coverage. This represents a critical risk for a high-performance pricing engine. We are flying blind.

## Solution
Execute a systematic coverage expansion strategy: fix the environment, establish a baseline, identify holes, and implement comprehensive unit and integration tests across all modules until >=96% coverage is achieved.

# Discussion/Comments

- 2026-02-04 Pickle Rick: Initialization. The baseline is a joke. Time to get to work.

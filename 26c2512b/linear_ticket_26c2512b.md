# Description

## Problem to solve
The application is experiencing various intermittent runtime errors across both frontend and backend, leading to unexpected behavior and a poor user experience. These errors need to be systematically diagnosed and resolved.

## Solution
This task involves identifying prevalent runtime errors through log analysis and user reports, reproducing them in a controlled environment, performing root cause analysis, and implementing robust fixes. Verification will include unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.

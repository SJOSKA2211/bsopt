# Description

## Problem to solve
The current logging and monitoring infrastructure lacks the granularity and proactivity required to quickly identify, diagnose, and prevent critical runtime errors, API failures, and performance bottlenecks.

## Solution
This task involves enhancing the application's logging mechanisms to capture more detailed and contextual information. It also includes improving monitoring dashboards and alerts to provide proactive notifications on deviations from baseline performance, error rate spikes, and resource utilization anomalies. Integration with existing tools (Grafana, Prometheus, Loki) will be key.

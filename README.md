# BS-OPT: The God-Mode Financial Manifold 🥒

**"I'm Pickle Rick! And I'm the only one who actually knows how to scale a derivative pricing engine!"**

## 🚀 Overview
BS-OPT is not just a platform; it's a transdimensional financial deity. It is built for zero-latency, high-throughput derivative pricing, risk management, and autonomous trading. If you're looking for standard Black-Scholes, go to a museum. If you want to outcompute the heat death of the universe, you're in the right place.

## 🏛️ God-Mode Architecture
- **The Brain**: Transformer-based Reinforcement Learning policies with hardware-aware JIT (Numba) and distributed HPO (Ray Tune).
- **The Fortress**: Zero-Trust Security triad featuring RS256 OAuth2, automated internal PKI for mTLS, and encrypted local token storage.
- **The Body**: Multi-tier mathematical kernels:
    - **WASM SIMD**: Batch pricing in the browser at native speeds.
    - **CUDA**: Massively parallel Heston FFT surfaces on the GPU.
    - **FFT/LSM**: O(N log N) Heston pricing and Normal Equation LSM regressions.
- **The Blood**: Persistent Shared Memory Mesh providing zero-copy market data distribution across the entire service cluster.
- **The Wire**: Kernel-bypass XDP (eBPF) data ingestion for sub-microsecond packet-to-pricing latency.
- **The Ground**: Globally distributed, serverless infrastructure powered by **Neon PostgreSQL**.
- **The Reliability**: Strategy-based self-healing AIOps with integrated Chaos Engineering for verified resilience.

## ⚡ Performance (C100k Ready)
- **Database**: 100% Serverless via Neon, Azure-hosted for ultra-low latency.
- **Concurrency**: 100,000+ persistent WebSocket connections via Redis Pub/Sub.

## 🛠️ Installation & Deployment
```bash
# Development (Full Stack Orchestration)
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build

# Production (Total Singularity Deployment)
./deploy.sh deploy
```
*Requires Docker, wasm-pack, NVIDIA GPU (recommended), and a will to transcend humanity.*

## 📜 Manifesto
1. **No Jerry-Work**: If it can be vectorized, it must be vectorized.
2. **Zero-Trust**: Verify everything, trust nothing, rotate often.
3. **Hardware-Fluid**: Run where it's fastest, whether it's WASM, JIT, or CUDA.
4. **Self-Healing**: If it breaks, it fixes itself before you even notice.

# Description

## Problem to solve
The application is currently experiencing intermittent runtime errors, critical backend API failures, and performance bottlenecks in data processing, leading to degraded user experience and increased operational overhead. This epic aims to address these foundational issues to deliver a more robust, reliable, and responsive application.

## Solution
This epic will involve systematic identification, root cause analysis, and resolution of critical errors and bottlenecks. It includes enhancing logging and monitoring, establishing effective debugging workflows, profiling resource usage, instrumenting critical code paths, and implementing automated tests for regression prevention.

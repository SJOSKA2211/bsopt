## 2024-05-23 - Frontend Worker Explosion
**Learning:** Found that `useWasmPricing` hook was creating a new Web Worker for *every* component instance. In `OptionsChain`, this meant 40+ workers were created on load (one for each cell), causing massive overhead.
**Action:** Implemented a Singleton Worker pattern in the hook. Always check if heavy resources like Workers or WebSocket connections are being created inside hooks used by list items. Use Context or Module-level Singletons to share them.

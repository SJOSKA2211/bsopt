# Description

## Problem to solve
Existing tests may be difficult to read, maintain, or may not effectively test the intended functionality. Improving the quality of these tests will contribute to a more robust and efficient testing process.

## Solution
Review existing tests in `testsprite_tests/` for readability, efficiency, and effectiveness. Refactor tests to follow best practices, remove duplication, and improve test data management where appropriate. This will ensure the test suite remains maintainable as it grows.

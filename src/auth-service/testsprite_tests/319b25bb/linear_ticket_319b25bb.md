# Description

## Problem to solve
Without continuous monitoring and clear reporting, it is difficult to track progress towards the 96% coverage target and ensure that new code maintains this standard.

## Solution
Set up or verify existing mechanisms for automatically generating test coverage reports (e.g., HTML, JSON, or console output). Establish a process for regularly reviewing these reports to ensure the 96% coverage target is met and sustained. This may involve integrating coverage checks into the CI/CD pipeline.

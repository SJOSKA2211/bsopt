# Description

## Problem to solve
The codebase requires debugging to resolve existing issues and achieve a minimum of 96% test coverage for critical modules, enhancing stability and maintainability.

## Solution
Break down the PRD into atomic tickets for research, bug fixing, and test coverage implementation. Ensure all tests pass and coverage targets are met. This epic ticket tracks the overall progress.

# Description

## Problem to solve
Ensure that all implemented bug fixes and new tests integrate correctly, and that the overall code coverage meets the 96% target.

## Solution
Execute the full test suite to confirm all tests pass. Verify that code coverage reports indicate at least 96% coverage for the targeted modules. Document the final coverage metrics.

# Description

## Problem to solve
Need to identify specific modules or areas in the codebase that are most critical for debugging and have the lowest test coverage, as a starting point for improvement efforts. This involves detailed code analysis with specific `file:line` references.

## Solution
Investigate the current codebase (`src/auth.ts`, `src/db.ts`, `src/index.ts`, `testsprite_tests/`) to pinpoint bugs and areas with coverage below 96%. Document findings with precise `file:line` references, focusing on objective data. The previous research document was rejected due to lack of detail and objectivity. This is a rework.

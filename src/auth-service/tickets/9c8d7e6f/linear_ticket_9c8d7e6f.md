# Description

## Problem to solve
Lack of clear documentation on bug fixes and test coverage strategies can hinder future maintenance and understanding of the codebase.

## Solution
Document the key bug fixes implemented and the strategies used to achieve the 96% test coverage target. This documentation should be clear, concise, and easily accessible.

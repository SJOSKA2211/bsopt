# Description

## Problem to solve
Certain areas of the codebase lack sufficient test coverage, falling below the target of 96%, which poses a risk of regressions and reduces confidence in code quality.

## Solution
Write new unit and/or integration tests to increase the code coverage for targeted modules. Ensure these tests are comprehensive, cover edge cases, and align with the overall code quality standards.
